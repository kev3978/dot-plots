https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/applesaucethebun/federal-reserve-dot-plot-2012-2023 and https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm

The dotplot data is typically issued with predictions for the end of the current year, the following 2 years, and the 'longer run'.

For the purposes of this chart, 'Longer run' data points saved as the year after the end of the predictions from that meeting. e.g. for 2012 Q1, 2012,2013,2014,Longer Run is transformed to 2012,2013,2014,2015.
